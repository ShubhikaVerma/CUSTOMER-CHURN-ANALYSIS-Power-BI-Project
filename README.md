# CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS-Power-BI-Project
The objective of this analysis is to discover various factors contributing to increased customer churn rate at the bank, and provide the business users with these insights which they can use to make informed decisions and strategize on how to improve customer retention and reduce churn rate.
About the data:The raw data was provided in the form of a CSV file with 10,000 rows of data. Data was sourced from a commercial bank who was looking to improve its customer churn rate.

## Data Modelling
![ModelView](https://github.com/ShubhikaVerma/CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS-Power-BI-Project/assets/146738903/079ea90b-df10-4f29-8f39-ea9261959032)

Here, I explored the relationship between these tables and how they are connected. I also arranged them so that all the fact tables were at the top of the dimension table. This is to make visualisation easy. Power BI pre-detected the cardinality of the model relationship as many-to-one which is correct.
